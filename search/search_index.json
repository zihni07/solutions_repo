The horizontal and vertical motions are independent, governed by the equations: \\[ x = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) t $$ $$ y = h + v_0 \\sin(\\theta) t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\] Solving for the range when \\( y = 0 \\) , we obtain: \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\] Implementation in Python The following Python script simulates projectile motion and visualizes the range vs. launch angle. Observations The range is maximized at \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) , as seen in the graph. Increasing initial velocity \\(v_0\\) extends the range. If the projectile is launched from a height \\(h > 0\\) , the time of flight increases, affecting the range. Limitations and Extensions Air resistance is neglected in this idealized model.
