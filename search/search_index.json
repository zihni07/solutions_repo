Computational Analysis A numerical simulation is used to track projectile motion. The range is computed as a function of the launch angle. A plot visualizes how range varies with angle. 3. Observations The optimal angle for maximum range is 45 degrees in an ideal scenario (no air resistance). Initial height affects the range significantly.

For small angles, we approximate \\( \\sin\\theta \\approx \\theta \\) , reducing the equation to a linear form: \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + b \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\omega_0^2 \\theta = A \\cos(\\omega t) \\] This linearized form allows for analytical solutions describing resonance and energy transfer within the system. Resonance Condition The system exhibits resonance when the driving frequency \\(\\omega\\) is close to the natural frequency \\(\\omega_0\\) , leading to large amplitude oscillations. Implementation in Python The following Python script simulates the motion of a forced damped pendulum using numerical methods. Observations When the damping is low and the driving frequency matches \\(\\omega_0\\) , resonance occurs, leading to large oscillations. As damping increases, oscillations decay, reducing amplitude. For certain parameter values, chaotic motion emerges, leading to irregular trajectories.

Poincar\u00e9 Sections: Stroboscopic sampling helps identify periodicity and chaos. Bifurcation Diagrams: Mapping steady-state solutions as parameters vary provides insights into chaotic transitions. Limitations and Extensions The model assumes a sinusoidal driving force; real-world systems may have non-periodic inputs. Air resistance and nonlinear damping effects are not included. Numerical solutions depend on step size and integration method precision. Applications The forced damped pendulum model is relevant in: - Engineering: Suspension bridges and mechanical resonance. - Physics: Driven RLC circuits. - Biomechanics: Human gait and balance control.
